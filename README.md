## 💡 About the project

> _This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode some of the libc functions and implemented new linked list functions.

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/NEIL-smtg/Libft/blob/main/en.subject.pdf).


## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```
